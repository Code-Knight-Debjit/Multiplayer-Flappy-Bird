Description:
-------------
Welcome to the Flappy Bird Multiplayer Game! This game allows you to play against the computer (AI) or a local friend. When playing against the computer, you can choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Instead of ending the game when hitting a pipe, the game deducts your score. The game runs until the player-inputted time is up, and then the scores are compared to determine the winner.

Game Modes:
-----------
1. Player vs Computer (AI):
   - Easy
   - Medium
   - Hard

2. Player vs Local Friend

Gameplay:
---------
- The game does not end when hitting a pipe. Instead, hitting a pipe deducts points from your score.
- You have to set a time limit for the game. The game will run until the time is up.
- Once the time is up, the scores are compared, and the player with the higher score wins.

Controls:
---------
- Player vs Computer (AI) Controls:
  - Spacebar: Jump/Flap

- Player vs Player (Local Player) Controls:
  - **Player 1 (Left Bird):**
    - Press the 'W' key to make the bird jump.

  - **Player 2 (Right Bird):**
    - Press the 'Up Arrow' key to make the bird jump.
